# My First Neural Network / Machine Learning Project 
I've looked into and have wanted to do machine learning for months now, I told myself, learn web 2.0 technology first, then I can focus on machine learning in my free time. But, today, I decided just to take a sneak-peak at what awaits me. 

This code is essentially from Youtube channel: LearnCode.academy - "Machine Learning Tutorial for Beginners - USING JAVASCRIPT!" 

I've known that machine learning can be done with Javascript, but ultimately, most tutorials have been in Python, and I didn't feel like using Python so this tutorial was perfect for me thus I just had to do it. 

Note: this is mostly a reference for beginners and I strongly recommend you use Siraj Raval's content to supplement your knowledge. 

Uses the Brain.js library.
